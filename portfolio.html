<h4>Here are the projects I've worked on so far from FreeCodeCamp's curriculum</h4>
<h4>Any other projects I work on outside FCC's curriculum will also be featured here.</h4>
<h4>All projects have a short description, and any FCC projects will have a link to the original project guidelines and user stories on FCC's site. All applicable projects will have a link to preview what the site looks like on CodePen as well as source code links to Github.</h4><br>

<div class="project-tile" id="treemap">
	<h3>Visualize Data with a Treemap Diagram</h3>
	<p>This is FCC's "Visualize Data with a Treemap Diagram" project found <a href="Visualize Data with a Treemap Diagram">here.</a> This last project was creating a treemap. There were multiple datasets to choose from and I chose the one that was video game sales by platform. There are no labels currently on the individual boxes but the tooltip shows the platform, game name, and value.</p><br>

<div class="project-tile" id="choropleth">
	<h3>Visualize Data with a Choropleth Map</h3>
	<p>This is FCC's "Visualize Data with a Choropleth Map" project found <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-choropleth-map">here.</a> This project was to make a choropleth map based on education rates across counties in the US. I had no idea what a choropleth map was before this project so that was a neat thing to learn. This was also a challenge because there were multiple JSON files to load and just going off the data sets would put the incorrect county data into the graph so that took a bit to figure out how to get the correct counties to show. The tooltip for this project shows the county name and the rate of bachelors degrees or higher in said county.</p><br>

	<h3>Visualize Data with a Heat Map</h3>
	<p>This is FCC's "Visualize Data with a Heat Map" project found <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-heat-map">here.</a> This is a heat map showing some variance to a base temperature. I'm not fully sure what it actually means though. Basically, each month in the years represented in the data has a variance to the base temp and the graph is color coded to show which month was higher and which was lower. You can hover over each box and a tooltip will show the year, and the variance.</p><br>

It has their year and the time they got. the dots are color coded based on if the rider in question had any doping allegations. There is a tooltip that displays each dot's rider, data, and any doping allegations if any on hover.</p><br>

	<p>This is FCC's "Visualize Data with a Bar Chart" project found <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-bar-chart">here.</a> This is the first of the data visualization projects using the D3 library. This is a simple bar chart using a given JSON dataset of the US' GDP. Please note, the given JSON is not continually updated, therefore the data will be outdated. There is a tooltip that will show the GDP value and the year/month of each bar as you mouse over it.</p><br>

	<p>This is FCC's "Build a Drum Machine" project found <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine">here.</a> This is a drum machine that plays soundbytes when you press a button. I had an idea with some different types of sounds but it didn't work so I used the ones from the FCC demo. I may revisit it in the future to try to implement the other idea I had.</p><br>

I made the site based on Python because I thought it would be interesting to look at the basics of another scripting language and see where it is similar and where it differs from JavaScript. I do plan on revisting and learning Python in the future and this website will be updated more as I study.</p><br>

Note, this one has major contrast issues which are there by design. I was also trying to experiment with colours here and was trying to apply them incorrectly. This may be updated in the future with even more poor contrast and can be used potentially as an example for others.</p><br>

	<p>This is FCC's "Build a Tribute Page" found <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page">here</a>. This was the first static website I built after learning the basics of HTML and CSS. It is very plain and while I would like to clean it up a little in the future, I find that having it in this state serves as a good starting point and hopefully it can be used to showcase my growth as I learn and practice more.</p><br>
