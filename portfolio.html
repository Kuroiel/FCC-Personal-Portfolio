<h4>Here are the projects I've worked on so far from FreeCodeCamp's curriculum</h4>
<h4>Any other projects I work on outside FCC's curriculum will also be featured here.</h4>
<h4>All projects have a short description, and any FCC projects will have a link to the original project guidelines and user stories on FCC's site. All applicable projects will have a link to preview what the site looks like on CodePen as well as source code links to Github.</h4><br>
<p>This site doesn't look very pretty for fancy right now, but it will be updated with additional CSS and projects as time allows.</p><br>

<div class="project-tile" id="documentation">
	<h3>Technical Documentation Page</h3>
	<p>This is FCC's "Build a Technical Documentation Page" project found <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page">here</a>. I made the site based on Python because I thought it would be interesting to look at the basics of another scripting language and see where it is similar and where it differs from JavaScript. I do plan on revisting and learning Python in the future and this website will be updated more as I study.</p><br>
